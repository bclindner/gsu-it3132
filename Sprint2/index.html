        <p>
        Georgia Southern offers excellent programs to their students in IT, Computer Science, and Information Systems, but many are not particularly familiar with all three, and tend to think that they are the same thing.

        <h1 class="compare-it">IT</h1>
        <p class="subtext">(Information Technology)</p>
        <p>...is the study and use of any computer systems for the purpose of storing, retrieving, and sending information, and operation of computer systems.
        <br/><br/>IT professionals are generally hands-on, and work with technology in professions like Web development, system administration, and information management.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="third">
        <h1 class="compare-cs">CS</h1>
        <p class="subtext">(Computer Science)</p>
        <p>...is the study of the principles and use of computers to solve problems. It is a scientific discipline that heavily involves theory and practice.
          <br/><br/>Where IT professionals <i>work with</i> technology, CS professionals <i>design</i> that technology. They work with computer systems at a low level by designing and programming for them.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="third">
        <h1 class="compare-is">IS</h1>
        <p class="subtext">(Information Systems)</p>
        <p>...is the study of the information generated by computer systems, especially in a business environment. IS students learn a combination of business and IT.
        <br/><br/>IS professionals are much different from IT and CS in that their line of work deals with management and the use of computer information to help businesses.</p>
